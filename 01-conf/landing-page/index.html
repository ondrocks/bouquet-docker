<h1>Hurray, it works !</h1>
<p>
Thanks for using Bouquet. We really appreciate it.
<br/>
If you can read this page, it means that Bouquet is working properly.

<p>
What have you just installed? A lot:
<ul>
<li>Bouquet server components, hosted as webapps in a Tomcat server</li>
<li>Apache2 as the web frontend</li>
<li>MongoDB, used to store metadata about your analytics</li>
<li>Redis, which is used as a cache and makes things run faster</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h1>Now what</h1>
<p>
How about checking out a really simple analytics app: an app to Export your data in a fast & easy way. <a href="http://api.squidsolutions.com/apps/release/app-export?apiUrl=localhost">Click here</a>, and away!
