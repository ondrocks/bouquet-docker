<h1>Hurray, it works !</h1>
<p>
Thanks for using Bouquet. We really appreciate it.
<br>
If you can read this page, it means that Bouquet is working properly. 
</p>
<p>
What have you just installed? A lot:
</p><ul>
<li><a href="http://openbouquet.io">Bouquet</a> server components, hosted as webapps in a Tomcat server</li>
<li>Apache2 as the web frontend</li>
<li><a href="https://www.mongodb.org/">MongoDB</a>, used to store metadata about your analytics</li>
<li><a href="http://www.redis.io/">Redis</a>, which is used as a cache and makes things run faster</li>
</ul>
Bouquet also brings an internal <a href="https://www.elastic.co/">Elasticsearch</a> server, that will automatically index your facets and provide you the best filtering experience using your data.
<p></p>

<h1>Now what ?</h1>
<p>
How about checking out a really simple analytics app: an app to Export your data in a fast &amp; easy way. <a id="open-app-export" href="http://openbouquet.io/apps/release/app-export/index.html" target="_blank">Click here</a>, and away!
</p>
<h3>I just clicked, and I'm asked for a login and password</h3>
<p>
You have been redirected to the authentication page of your Bouquet instance, where you can use the login "super" with the password "super123".
</p>

<h3>I just authenticated, but now I see openbouquet.io on my address bar , not my Bouquet installation!</h3>
<p>
Great, now you're authenticated. But don't worry, you're still using your Bouquet instance. See that <code>?apiUrl=</code> at the end of the address ? That's it. That's the address of the Docker container that hosts your own Bouquet server.
</p>
<p>
That's the power of Bouquet's API. You can use whatever javascript application from whatever website you want. If this application uses <a href="https://github.com/squidsolutions/jssdk2">Bouquet's javascript SDK</a>, you can use the <code>apiUrl</code> parameter to point to the Bouquet server you need.
</p>
<p>
The javascript application does not directly access the data. That's why you don't even need to get it via HTTPS. Your browser downloads the application, and the locally-executed javascript connects to the Bouquet server hosted in your Docker container.
</p>
<h3>Now that I can use Bouquet with this app, how do I connect to my database?</h3>
<p>
That's where the real fun begins. Follow the instructions <a href="https://bouquet.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204891062-About-the-Export-App">right here</a>.
